# react-youtube-videoplayer

Practice app to continue learning React.

##This is intended to be used as a reference app. As such, the codebase will include:

* Dead code (commented out) that has been re-factored. E.g. a Functional
	component that has been re-factored to a Class based component.
* Copious (over-abundant & verbose) explanatory comments that explain,
	sometimes in minute detail, the purpose of (e.g.) a line or block of code.
