Practice app to continue learning React.

A good overview of key React concepts can be found
[here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-5-things-you-need-to-know-to-understand-react-a1dbd5d114a3#.obts5zea2).

## This is intended to be used as a reference app. As such, the codebase will include:

* Dead code (commented out) that has been re-factored. E.g. a Functional
	component that has been re-factored to a Class based component.
* Copious (over-abundant & **very** verbose) explanatory comments that detail,
	sometimes minutely, the purpose of (e.g.) a line or block of code.


## Some React concepts that can be gleaned from this app:
* Functional (stateless) vs Class-based components
* Passing a callback function as a prop down two levels (App -> VideoList -> VideoListItem)
* **this.setState**. A more thorough, plain-English explanation of how React updates state can be read [here](https://medium.com/@tylermcginnis/react-interview-questions-c8a319ed02bd#.olmgbts1h).

## A much more readable codebase can be found in the "clean" branch of this repo.
